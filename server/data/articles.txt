Bring some waterproof gear if you want to get close or behind as you will certainly get covered in cold water.<br/><br/>You can also trek a bit along the cliffs to see the waterfall from a distance.',
    'This is the most well-known waterfall in Iceland and for a reason. From the bottom or the top, the view you get there are breathtaking. If you have the chance, there is a camping not 200m from the base of the waterfall.<br/><br/>If you want to hike a bit and discover this place hidden secret, we recommend you climb up the stairs on the right of “Skógafoss” and then continue on the path.

    'For its access from the golden circle and its luscious vegetation, Gullfoss is a must see. If you plan the golden circle tour, we highly recommend you stop there. The most impressive feature, other than the high water volume that tumble down this waterfall, was to see how much the waterfall has an impact on the local fauna. With all the moisture coming up and settling down onto both side of the ravine, thick grass and shrubs were flourishing. That is something you won’t see at other waterfall.',
    'Not a waterfall per name, this canyon containing small rivers is definitely something to see. To get there, you will need exit route 1, use the dirt road and drive about 4km. With this, you will be far from tourists buses that can’t reach this place. That makes it a quiet spot, where only locals and brave tourist will be present. You will find there a canyon covered in moss, where you will probably take the best picture of your trip.',
    'Contrary to most waterfall, this one pour water filled with volcanic ashes and dirt. Even if this is not your average clear water waterfall, the sheer volume of water passing through will amaze you. Considered the most powerful waterfall in Europe (Yes, Iceland is part or Europe) with it’s 200m3/s this is certainly a breath taker.',
    'Filled with history, this waterfall is also one of the most well-known in Iceland. The story says that after an Icelandic “Lögsögumad” (judge) convinced the “Alþingi” (Icelandic parliament) to adopts Christianity, he returned home to his village near this waterfall and, as an example of the new ways, decides to throw idols of the old Nordic religion in this fall. The “Goðafoss”, or waterfall of the gods was then named after this event.',

We highly recommend a guided tour as you can easily get answer all the questions you may have on the origins, production, bottling, aging process, grape types, Vintage VS LBV ports, and even more.',
    'Available tasting. All cellar in the area offers a visit/tasting tour, but only some of them have the best experience for your bucks. Look for the cellar that deduct the price of the tour when you buy a bottle (You will most probably buy one either way), and ones that offer a wide variety of tasting ports. You may want to taste a young Ruby port, a white port, either a LBV or a Vintage and old port (20, 30 or even 40 years old). Those tastings will greatly help you determine which one you like the most.',
    'Exclusive or hard to find portos. Visiting a cellar is an opportunity to find bottles that are either not available in your region or too expensive.',
    'Last but not least, price. You can find an amazing guided cellar visit with a great selection of tasting options for around 10-15$ per person, depending on the season. Any higher that this and you may have overpaid for your visit.',
